            <strong>Ary Mega.</strong><br>

            American-Indonesian father and husband from Los Angeles, California. Was Sr. UX at <a href="https://techstylefashiongroup.com/" title="TechStyle Fashion Group" target="_blank">@Fabletics</a>. Owned <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cvmpus" title="CVMPUS" target="_blank">@CVMPUS</a>. Now WFH <a href="https://awwwry.com/" title="@AWWWRY" target="_blank">@COVID19</a>.<br><br>
        </h1>

        <p>Previously responsible for leading the global user experience at Fabletics.</p>
        
        <p>Currently trading options. Scalping naked calls/puts and swinging credit spreads and iron condors using MACD, moving averages and a 30% stop loss.</p>
        
        <p>Before I YOLO on a trade, I typically rely on the homie Elliot's wave principle to identify which wave I'll be surfing, examine my entry with the fibonacci retracement tool and project my exit with the fibonacci extension cord. Supes simps; nothing complicated.</p>

        <p>
          Current strategy:<br><br>
          🕐 Mondays: Day trade, entry after 6:45 AM (PST), goal 20-30% profit<br>
          🕑 Tuesdays: Day trade, entry after 6:45 AM (PST), exit before London market closes. Swing $SPY credit spread w/ exp. date for next day (Wednesday)<br>
          🕒 Wednesdays: Exit $SPY credit spread early if no signs of 100% profit by market close<br>
          🕓 Thursdays: Day trade, entry after 6:45 AM (PST), exit before London market closes. Swing $SPY or $QQQ credit spread w/ exp. date for next day (Friday)<br>
          🕔 Fridays: Exit credit spread early if no signs of 100% profit by market close.

        <p>Shout out to TradingView for helping a ninja out with technical analysis and Robinhood and WeBull for handlin' the fun funds. Robinhood with the Level 3 spreads; WeBull with ghetto spreads until they release Level 3 options.</p>
        
        <p>After trading hours, I'll spend time creating and remixing design systems and user interfaces, build front-end web apps with NodeJS and SCSS and experiement with Three.js. Supes simps; nothing complicated.</p>
        
        <p>Currently remixing an trading algo app using NodeJS — scrappin' up unusal option flows and darkpool orders. Supes simps; nothing complicated.</p>
