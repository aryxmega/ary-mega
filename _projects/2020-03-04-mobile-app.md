#### Installation is supes eaze:

-   Clone: [https://github.com/awwwry/supes-simps-grids-sys.git](https://github.com/awwwry/supes-simps-grids-sys.git)

#### Link-up the stylesheet in your <head>

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style/sheet.css">
```

#### Structurin' your layouts real nasty.
```html
<div class="wrap">
    <div class="block-3">Content here</div>
    <div class="block-3">Content here</div>
    <div class="block-3">Content here</div>
</div>
```
Creating a three-column layout, for example, is supes simps. Wrap the `.block`'s in a `.wrap` class to clear the left floats.

**Note:** this will scale each column down to 100% width on mobile.

#### Gettin' fluid widdit.
Maybe you want to kick-it old school and create a two-column layout based on percentage. It's mad simps. As long as the `.block-` classes equal 100%, shit'll will be fire ðŸ”¥
```html
<div class="wrap">
    <div class="block-75">Some rad content here</div>
    <div class="block-25">Some informational content here</div>
</div>
```

{% include post-components/gallery.html
	columns = 1
	full_width = true
	images = "/images/projects/mobile-app/mobile-app-01.png,/images/projects/mobile-app/mobile-app-02.png
	"
%}

#### That's it.
